python-ssis

In this repo, I've created SSIS packages and Python scripts to show how Python logic can be invoked directly from SSIS.

The 4 packages, with numbers in the file names indicating the increasing level of sophistication, show how to go from a simple
Python script execution all the way to a fully dynamic SSIS-to-Python orchestrator with native SSIS logging for informational
and error messages.

You can find the corresponding blog post, with step-by-step explanations and screenshots of the development, here:
